Created a Temperature Conversion application as described below. 

The app should allow the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions. Conversion is selected using Radio Buttons. 

All conversion operations and their results should be added to the “history” – a list of converted values. The history of converted values must be scrollable and displayed with the most recent conversions at the top of the list.

Pressing the “Clear” button will clear the conversion history.
